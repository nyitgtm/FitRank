# FitRank iOS App

FitRank is a community-driven fitness app that gamifies workout logging and peer validation of lifts. It combines video lift uploads, workout tracking, and team-based leaderboards, backed by Firebase services.

## Features

### üèãÔ∏è Core Functionality
- **Video Workout Recording**: Record and upload workout videos with camera integration
- **Lift Validation**: Community rating system (+1/-1) for workout form validation
- **Team Competition**: Join one of three fixed teams (Killa Gorillas, Dark Sharks, Regal Eagles)
- **Gamification**: Token system for positive community engagement
- **GPS Tagging**: Automatic location tagging for gym-based features

### üèÜ Leaderboards
- **Global Leaderboard**: Rank all users by tokens earned
- **Team Leaderboard**: Compete within your team
- **Gym Leaderboard**: See top lifts at specific gym locations

### üë• Community Features
- **Comments**: Add feedback and discussion to workouts
- **Reporting**: Flag inappropriate content for moderation
- **Coach System**: Special privileges for verified coaches
- **Content Moderation**: Automatic flagging of downvoted content

## Architecture

### MVVM Pattern
The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel architecture for clean separation of concerns:

- **Models**: Data structures for User, Workout, Rating, Comment, Gym, Report
- **ViewModels**: Business logic and state management (UserViewModel, WorkoutViewModel, etc.)
- **Views**: SwiftUI user interface components
- **Components**: Reusable UI elements (WorkoutCardView, TeamBadgeView, etc.)

### Firebase Integration
- **Authentication**: Email/password user management
- **Firestore**: NoSQL database for all app data
- **Storage**: Video file storage and management
- **Cloud Functions**: Automated backend workflows
- **Security Rules**: Comprehensive data access control

```

## Data Models

### User
- Profile information (name, username, team)
- Role flags (coach, admin)
- Token balance for gamification

### Workout
- Video URL and metadata
- Weight, lift type, and location
- Community ratings and view counts
- Moderation status

### Rating
- User votes (+1/-1) on workouts
- Prevents duplicate voting
- Updates workout statistics

### Comment
- Text feedback on workouts
- Like/dislike system
- Moderation capabilities

## Firebase Schema

### Collections
- `/users/{userId}` - User profiles and settings
- `/workouts/{workoutId}` - Workout videos and metadata
- `/ratings/{ratingId}` - User ratings on workouts
- `/comments/{commentId}` - Comments on workouts
- `/gyms/{gymId}` - Gym locations and records
- `/reports/{reportId}` - Content moderation reports

### Security Rules
- Users can only modify their own data
- Public read access for published content
- Coach/admin privileges for moderation
- Rate limiting and validation rules

## Cloud Functions

### Automated Workflows
- **Content Moderation**: Flag workouts with >40% downvotes after 100 views
- **Token Distribution**: Award tokens for positive engagement
- **Leaderboard Snapshots**: Weekly leaderboard calculations
- **Gym Champions**: Update gym records for new personal bests
