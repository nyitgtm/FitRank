# Progress Tracker - Calendar View Implementation

## New Features

### üìÖ Calendar Week View
- **Main Display**: Each day shows:
  - Day of week and date
  - **Pounds lost per day** (calculated from calorie deficit)
  - Calories consumed
  - Calorie deficit/surplus with status emoji
  - Progress bar vs maintenance
  - Macro breakdown (P, C, F)

### üîÄ Week Navigation
- **Back Button** (‚óÄÔ∏è): Go to previous weeks
- **Date Display**: Shows week date range and week number
- **Next Button** (‚ñ∂Ô∏è): Go to forward weeks (disabled when on current week)
- Smooth navigation between all weeks with logged data

### ‚öôÔ∏è Settings Button
- Located in **top right corner**
- Opens modal to adjust:
  - Daily Maintenance Calories (TDEE)
  - Target Weight Loss Per Week (1-2 lbs recommended)
  - Current Weight

### üìä Stats Summary
- **Total Deficit**: Sum of all daily deficits for the week
- **Projected Weight Loss**: Total deficit √∑ 3,500 calories/lb
- **Daily Maintenance**: Your TDEE
- **Target Weight Loss**: Your weekly goal
- **Daily Deficit Needed**: Deficit required daily to hit goal
- **Target Daily Calories**: Maintenance - deficit needed

### üìç Daily Status Indicators
Emojis show deficit quality:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Over** - Ate more than maintenance
- üìâ **Low** - Small deficit (< 200 cal)
- ‚úÖ **Good** - Moderate deficit (200-500 cal)
- üî• **Great** - Large deficit (> 500 cal)

## How Weight Loss is Calculated

### Per Day
```
Weight Lost Per Day = Daily Calorie Deficit √∑ 3,500
Example: 500 cal deficit √∑ 3,500 = 0.14 lbs per day
```

### Per Week
```
Weekly Weight Loss = Sum of Daily Deficits √∑ 3,500
Example: 3,500 cal deficit √∑ 3,500 = 1 lb per week
```

## Data Sync Process

1. **App Launch** ‚Üí Progress Tracker View loads
2. **onAppear** ‚Üí `syncWithMealLogger()` is called
3. **Sync Logic**:
   - Reads all meal log dates
   - For each meal log without progress data:
     - Calculates calories consumed
     - Calculates deficit vs maintenance
     - Creates DailyProgress entry
   - Updates weekly summaries
4. **Storage** ‚Üí Everything saved to UserDefaults
5. **Display** ‚Üí Shows current week by default, allows navigation

## Files Modified

### ProgressTrackerView.swift
- Added `selectedWeekOffset` state for week navigation
- Added `WeekNavigationHeader` component
- Added `CalendarWeekView` for calendar grid layout
- Added `CalendarDayCell` showing pounds lost per day
- Moved settings button to top right (navigationBarHidden)
- Added proper week switching logic

### Models/ProgressTracker.swift
- Already has all calculations needed
- `dailyProgresses` tracks all days
- `getWeeklyProgress()` retrieves specific weeks

### ViewModels/ProgressTrackerViewModel.swift
- `syncWithMealLogger()` pulls Meal Logger data
- Automatically creates progress entries

## How to Use

1. **Open Progress Tracker** from Nutrition Hub
2. **See current week** with all daily data
3. **Adjust settings** via gear icon ‚Üí set maintenance and weight loss goal
4. **Navigate weeks** with back/forward arrows
5. **View each day** showing:
   - Pounds lost that day
   - Calories consumed
   - Deficit status
   - Macro breakdown

## Storage

All data stored locally in UserDefaults:
- `progressTracker_data` contains all daily progress and settings
- Syncs with Meal Logger data automatically
- Persists across app sessions
